Features
Instant Finality: Transactions settle immediately between parties
Reduced Gas Costs: Most interactions happen off-chain, with minimal on-chain footprint
High Throughput: Support for thousands of transactions per second
Security Guarantees: Same security as on-chain, with cryptographic proofs
Framework Agnostic: Works with any JavaScript framework (Vue, Angular, React, etc.)
Installation
npm install @erc7824/nitrolite
Quick Start
Nitrolite is our official SDK for creating high-performance decentralized applications. It provides a comprehensive set of functions and types to establish WebSocket connections with ClearNode and manage application sessions.

Prerequisites
Before you begin working with Nitrolite, ensure that you have:

Node.js: Version 16 or later
Package Manager: npm, yarn, or pnpm
Development Environment:
For frontend: React, Vue, or similar framework
For backend: Node.js environment
Channel Setup: Create a channel from your account at apps.yellow.com
ClearNode WebSocket
ClearNode WebSocket URL: wss://clearnet.yellow.com/ws

Next steps
Building applications with Nitrolite involves these key steps:

Channel Creation: Create a channel from your account at apps.yellow.com
ClearNode Connection: Establish WebSocket connection for off-chain messaging
Application Sessions: Create sessions to run specific applications
Session Closure: Properly close application sessions when finished
We recommend working through these guides in sequence to understand the complete application workflow. Each guide builds on concepts from previous sections.

Start with the Channel Creation guide to begin your journey with Nitrolite applications.
