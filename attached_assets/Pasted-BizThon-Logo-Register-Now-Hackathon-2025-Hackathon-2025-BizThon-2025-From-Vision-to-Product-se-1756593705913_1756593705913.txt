Problem Statement
About the Yellow SDK & the Nitrolite Protocol
The Nitrolite Protocol is a chain-agnostic, high-performance development toolkit built by Yellow to simplify and accelerate the creation of Web3 apps. At its core are ERC-7824 state channels, which allow developers to move interactions off-chain while maintaining security, auditability, and final settlement on-chain.

Instead of forcing every action through expensive, slow blockchain calls, Nitrolite abstracts away the complexity — enabling real-time, gasless user experiences that feel like Web2, but are trustless and verifiable.

What you’ll be building?
At this hackathon, your mission is to integrate the Yellow SDK to build scalable Web3 products where state channels are used to:

Handle frequent user interactions (e.g., gameplay, payments, bidding) off-chain
Create gasless, low-latency, and chain-abstracted UX
Show real-world value in DeFi, gaming, fintech, AI, prediction markets, or anything else that benefits from speed, scale, and simplicity
To qualify, projects must include
Technical Documentation (PDF/PPT)
Demo Video (2-5 min)
Active Project URL (if applicable)
Code Repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
Fast track selection
Submit your idea early to receive quick feedback and more time to refine your project.
High-impact solutions using the real Yellow & Nitrolite SDK will gain priority consideration.
Evaluation Criteria
Projects will be assessed based on the following key factors:
Use the Nitrolite SDK for off-chain logic - (ERC-7824)
Creativity & Innovation - Does the project introduce fresh and original ideas?
Technical Execution - Is the implementation robust, functional, and efficient?
Real-World Utility - Does the solution address a significant problem effectively?
Scalability & Adoption - Can the project expand beyond the hackathon and reach wider adoption?
